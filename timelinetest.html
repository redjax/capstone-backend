                                Founded in 1833 by two Presbyterian ministers, John Shipherd and Philo P. Stewart, the city of Oberlin began as an evangelical
                                community designed to educate teachers and ministers. During the same time, the two ministers
                                formed Oberlin College to further educate the “Godless West,” as they called it.
                                </>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    The Oberlin Heritage Center reports that in 1841, the first three women in the nation to earn their Bachelor’s Degrees do
                                    so from Oberlin College. In 1846, Lucy Stone, a noted women’s rights activist and abolitionist,
                                    graduated from the college. Her sister-in-law, Antoinette Brown Blackwell, follows the
                                    next year. Later, Blackwell becomes the first female ordained minister of a recognized
                                    denomination in the United States.
                                </p>

                                    In 1835, Oberlin admitted James Bradley, the first African American to attend the school. Oberlin’s Anti-Slavery Society
                                    was formed the same year.

                                The town quickly turned into a hub of anti-slavery activity. Carol Lasser, professor of history for Oberlin College, wrote
                                about the intersection of religion and politics that created and facilitated the movement
                                in the city in “The Underground Railroad in Oberlin: History and Memory.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Opposition to slavery found its expression not only in the election of antislavery state and national candidates, but also
                                in the pointed assertions of African American equality,” she wrote. “Oberlin had not only
                                a college that was a pioneer in the higher education of African Americans; it also had public
                                schools that educated white and African American children side by at a time when the state
                                of Ohio did not require black schooling, much less integrated classrooms.”

                                Lasser tells of the first documented experience of the Underground Railroad in Oberlin, which was discovered through an 1837
                                letter. A student formally enrolled at Oberlin college brought a wagon filled with fugitives
                                into the city.

                                “They took supper in the college dining hall, where students crowded around them,” she writes. “On the Sabbath, they rested
                                in Evangelically correction Oberlin, and on the following Monday were sent on their way with
                                a guard of students ensuring their safe passage.”

                                The City of Oberlin reports the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue on its main site, one of the most famous events that occurred in
                                the city.

                                In 1859, John Price, a free black man, was kidnapped by Kentucky slave catchers and two Columbus deputies. Once word reached
                                abolitionists in the city, men and women went to the Wadsworth Hotel in Wellington, Lorain
                                County, where the kidnappers were holding Price.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When negotiations to free the man failed, the crowd rushed into the hotel and created so much chaos that Price was able to
                                escape. “Hidden in Oberlin College President James Fairchild’s attic for a few days, Price
                                was then sent on to Canada and never heard from again,” the site reads. “Twenty-seven men
                                who aided in Price’s escape were arrested for opposing the Fugitive Slave Act. While awaiting
                                trial, the men chose to stay in jail and printed the newspaper “The Rescuer.”

                                of the twenty-seven men were released from jail and the charges were dropped.” {NEEDS BETTER
