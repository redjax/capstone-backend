    <h2>About This Page</h2>
<p class="ram"> In this web-site I have described about my favorite places in India and USA so far. This list is limited with the places which i have visited so far. I have prepared this list by asking questions my self such as "How much fun i had overthere?" "How much do I want to go back?" and "How much blown away was I by it?" and ordered my list loosely based on the answers.

<h2 class="name">Golconda Fort</h2>
<p class="ram2 col-8"> Golconda Fort was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Golconda which flourished in the 14th to 16th century. It is situated 11 kilometers from Hyderabad, the capital of the state of Telangana. With walls ranging from 17 to 34 feet broken by 87 semi-circular bastions, some reaching 60 feet in height, and built on a granite hill that is 400 feet high, it remains one of India’s most magnificent fortress complexes.</p>

<h2 class="name">Taj-Mahal</h2>

<p class="ram2 col-8"> The Taj Mahal is considered the finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements from Persian, Indian, and Islamic architectural styles. In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was cited as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage."

The Taj! An awe-inspiring poetry in marble stands high and serene by the banks of the River Yamuna is an inspiring result of the application of architectural and scientific research.</p>

<h2 class="name">Khajuraho</h2>

<p class="ram2 col-8"> The temples at Khajuraho were built during the Chandella dynasty, which reached its apogee between 950 and 1050. Only about 20 temples remain; they fall into three distinct groups and belong to two different religions – Hinduism and Jainism. They strike a perfect balance between architecture and sculpture. The Temple of Kandariya is decorated with a profusion of sculptures that are among the greatest masterpieces of Indian art.</p>
